# Ethaun Real Estate

I've built my own **NFT Real Estate dApp**.

**Ethuan** was made to simplify the real estate process

It is a platform where different users can inspect, lend, administrate, buy, and sell properties all inside of one Blockchain.

here is the main site

The process is simple...

When someone wishes to buy a property :house_with_garden:, it will require a few things
* step 1

Somone to sell the property :moneybag:

* step 2 

Someone to inspect the property :mag_right:

* step 3

Someone to lend money to the buyer if needed 💸

* step 4

Someone to review and confirm all of the above :pushpin:

Payment will be of course in ETH. :small_blue_diamond:

The user interface will change depending on the wallet owner's role

This dApp was built using

## Front end

* React
* Node
* Ethers

## Back end

* Hardhat
* Solidity
* ERC721
* IPFS

## Storage Service

The properties NFT image and metadata were uploaded to pinata IPFS :carousel_horse:

And the smart contracts here were deployed to the Hardhat localhost node to simulate multiple users accounts
