# Ethaun Real Estate

Here is my own **NFT Real Estate dApp**.

**Ethuan** was made to simplify the real estate process

It is a platform where different users can inspect, lend, administrate, buy, and sell properties using ERC721 (NFTs).

here is the main site

# Theory

The process is simple...

When someone wishes to buy a property :house_with_garden:, it will require a few things
* step 1

Somone to sell the property :moneybag:

* step 2 

Someone to inspect the property :mag_right:

* step 3

Someone to lend money to the buyer if needed 💸

* step 4

Someone to review and confirm all of the above :pushpin:

Payment will be of course in ETH. :small_blue_diamond:

# User Interface
The user interface will change depending on the wallet owner's role
here is an example...
